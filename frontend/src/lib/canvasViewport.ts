// Which cards of a canvas are worth rendering.
//
// A canvas is one absolutely-positioned board: every card parses its markdown
// (and each file/note card asks the core for the note's text or image) when it
// mounts. On a big map that mount cost is the freeze, so only the cards inside
// the visible rect — plus an overscan margin, so cards do not pop in at the very
// edge while panning — are rendered, together with the edges that touch them.
